## Description

This is the client side half of an app called Boomtown. The purpose of the app is to allow users to "share" items and "borrow" other users items.

The app is built off a starter package using React and Redux and takes advantage of the react-router and redux-thunk libraries.

## New Technologies Used

* React/react-router
* Redux/redux-thunk
* GraphQL
* Apollo
* Node Express

## todo

* improve error handling on both login form and share form
* use and understand dataloaders
* all the proptypes (sorry)
* add borrow and delete mutations
* refactor from redux for filter to apollo-link-state
* probably a lot of refactoring as I learn
