## Description

This is the client side half of an app called Boomtown. The purpose of the app is to allow users to "share" items and "borrow" other users items.

The app is built off a starter package using React and Redux and takes advantage of the react-router and redux-thunk libraries.

## New Technologies Used

* React/react-router/react-router-redux
* Redux/redux-thunk
* fetch

## todo

* use local storage
* probably a lot of refactoring as I learn
* finish out the project by building out the server
