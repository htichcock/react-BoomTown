## Description

This is the client side half of an app called Boomtown. The purpose of the app is to allow users to "share" items and "borrow" other users items.

The app is built off a starter package using React and Redux and takes advantage of the react-router and redux-thunk libraries.

## New Technologies Used

* React/react-router
* Redux/redux-thunk
* fetch

## Personal Learnings

I feel more and more comfortable using react and redux and managing state through the store. It was really tough to map the application
